<h2>Top 5 Soda Drinks in jordan 2024 </h2>
<hr />
<h3>5. Sama</h3>
<p> Sama is a good drink in my opinion but it has a weird taste in my opinion when drinking it.<br />
I dont think it feels as refreshing as the other drinks but its not bad.</p>
<h3>4. Super</h3>
<p>Super is a really weird carbonated drink because it has many flavors but a lot of them are bad there are only a few that are really good but generally it not really tasty but i recommend the blueberry flavor it really good.</p>
<h3>3. matrix</h3>
<p>matrix is a drink that is really popular here, I think its better than the 2 drinks above but its still not as good as the 2 that are ahead because it has that wiered after taste that makes me not like it as much as the others.</p>
<h3>2. sinalco</h3>
<p>sinalco  is a really good cola and its tasty and i think its one of the best ones out there. I strongly recommend it but if you had to choose between it and number 1 then dont choose this becase number 1 is really better in my opinion.</p>
<h3>1. kenza</h3>
<p>Kenza is the best soda drink out there in my opinion, it has a really good after taste and its really dilicious in  my opinion and soo refreshing. I always drink it when its sold and its the best one out there so i really reccomend it.</p>
